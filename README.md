# EOPL
My (kinda bad) Essentials of Programming Langauges code/solutions
This is for the second edition, I'm using Racket's built in EOPL lang. It's kind of frustrating because I'm fairly new to Scheme, and there seems to be no continuations either? So as of now, my code is honestly kind of ugly and probably really ineffecient. Not sure if I'm missing something though, maybe I'm just making excuses.
